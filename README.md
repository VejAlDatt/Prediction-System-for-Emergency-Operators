# Prediction-System-for-Emergency-Operators

The rescue service faces challenges in planning standby duty for rescue drivers. Currently, 90 drivers are kept on standby every day, but this method is inefficient due to the unpredictable nature of short-term illnesses and emergency calls. As a data science consultant, my goal is to assist the HR department by developing a forecasting model to estimate the required number of standby rescue drivers more accurately. The objective is to improve the activation rate of standby drivers and minimize instances where there aren't enough drivers available. The final plan is due on the 15th of this month for implementation in the following month. This project aims to create a more effective and efficient standby-duty planning process.

**Please note that its is advised to open the project in Google Colabortory, due to rendering issue with GitHub.**
