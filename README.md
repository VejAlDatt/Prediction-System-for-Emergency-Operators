# Prediction-System-for-Emergency-Operators

The Berlin red-cross rescue service faces challenges in planning standby-duty for rescue drivers. Currently, 90 drivers are kept on standby every day, but this approach is not efficient due to the unpredictable nature of short-term sickness and emergency calls. As a data science consultant, I aim to help the HR department by creating a forecasting model that estimates the number of daily standby rescue drivers more efficiently. The goal is to increase the percentage of standbys being activated and reduce the occurrence of situations with not enough standbys. The final plan must be finished on the 15th of the current month for the upcoming month. This project will provide a more effective and efficient approach to standby-duty planning for the Berlin red-cross rescue service.

**Please note that its is advised to open the project in Google Collabortory, due to rendering issue with GitHub.**
